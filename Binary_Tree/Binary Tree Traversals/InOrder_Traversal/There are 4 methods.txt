1. Using Recursion                                 TC = O(N) , SC = O(1) if you don't consider the size of recursion stack. 
2. Using One Stack                                            TC = O(N) , SC = O(N) 
3. Using Morris Traversal (Threaded and Non thread)           TC = O(N) , SC = O(1) 
4. Iterative way (one stack)                                  TC = O(N) , SC = O(N)
